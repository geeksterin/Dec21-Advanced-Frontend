5. PATCH - It is when we want to UPDATE the data.

6. async / await -> Syntactical Sugar of Promises. (Just syntax change, more easy to read and write).
-> Any await HAS to be written inside ASYNC.

-> ASYNC -> It means, that the function is Asynchronous. The function will return a promise.
-> AWAIT -> Wait until the PROMISE is completed.

5. Network Calls -> fetch



Difference between PUT and POST:
-> If you have the ID of that data, you use PUT. If you don't have the ID, you use POST.
-> POST is similar to array.push().
