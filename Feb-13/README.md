1. JSX -> JavaScriptXML
-> It gives us added benefit of writing HTML code in JS file in a very neat fashion.
2. We can do React without JSX! But JSX makes life very easy.

3. React Props -> Properties we set as an Attribute for the child component which is handled by React automagically / automatically.
(Automagically -> Automatically + Magically)

4. React State -> The collection of data which is observed by React for the changes which are most of the times passed as props.
-> A set of observable properties that control the behaviour of the component.

5. Conditional Rendering -> Change the output based on a condition.

6. Map on an array -> Foreach with return.
