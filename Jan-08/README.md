1. JS CConcepts (Prerequisite for getting into React)- 
- Modules
- ES6
- Arrow functions
- Async JS (Event Loop, Task Queue, Await)
- NPM
- Const and Let.
- Inheritance and OOP concepts. (Kind of like prototype)

-> Hosting is moving declaration at the top of execution scope. (Before the actual code execution).

1. Spread Operator
2. Ternary Operator
3. Hoisting -> TDZ - Temporal Dead Zone
4. Call Stack - It is a mechanism which will keep track of the function call. Which function is being executed and which is the caller function and who this function will call.
5. Web API - API is an interface which allows communication between two pieces of software.
- Web API allows communication between JS Engine and the Browser - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
6. Task Queue - It is a queue (FIFO) which contains the callbacks which has to be executed.
7. Event Loop - This is the loop which runs inifinitely which will check the Callstack and if that is empty then pick the task from the Task Queue and push it in the Callstack.

Assignment:
1. Create a UI for a quiz Game similar to KBC. (MAke it look as close to the real one as possible.)
2. Create a UI for Stopwatch and implement the lap functionality (Basically when I click on the lap button, it should create a list and add that time into the list). (Start, Pause and Reset functionalities.)

5. Event Loop (Call Stack, Task Queue)
6. Promises .then -> Async Await
7. Web API / Web Workers -> session, cookies / localstorage.
8. Network Calls -> fetch (XHR)
9. OOP and ES6 -> constructor and destructor.
3. Scope Chaining
