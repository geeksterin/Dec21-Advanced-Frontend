7. Action / Reducer / Store and View (4 pillars of Redux)
-> Action - What to do - It is an object. With the TYPE key.
-> Reducer - How to do - It is a function which takes the current state and action. Then returns the new state.
-> Store -> Object which contains the whole state, every store has only 1 reducer function.
-> Components / View -> The frontend.
