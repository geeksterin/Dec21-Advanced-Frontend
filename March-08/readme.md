assignment

- use following API with fetch - https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

store the result in redux store
and read from there and display all data
dont store any API data in your component state

//hint
instead of setting state, dispatch action with some payload (eg-api data)
save the payload in your redux store from your reducer
