develop an app with infinite scroll and infinite pictures.

As a user i want to scroll through the app and see different pictures as long as i want.


you are free to implement it your way but in order to have infinite pictures you need an api providing infinite pictures.

one such api is unsplash.


go to https://unsplash.com/developers and read documentation. how to use it and all !



hint how to develop this application:

step 1: fetch 10 pictures from unsplash api  ( you can fetch any number of pictures initially )

step 2: render this pictures in browser

step 3: check if user hit the bottom of webpage while scrolling , if yes fetch 10 more pictures and repeat step 1 to 3.
