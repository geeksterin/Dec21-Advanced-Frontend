- .then -> It is used to success state.
- .catch -> It is used to failure state.

Assignment 1.
- For the KBC Assignment. Prepare the question list and have it externally in JSON format and load it in the game via fetch.
- When the files are loaded, show the UI. Show 4 options and add eventListener. Based on that check whether the answer is correct or not. If correct. Increase the winning amount and change the question. Start the 30 second timer again.
If incorrect answer, give the total money and say bye bye.
If the 30 second timer is done. Then also say bye bye. 👋🏻
