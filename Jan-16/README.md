1. DRY -> Don't Repeat Yourself (âœ”)
2. Modular Programming Paradigm -> The whole code is consisting of small modules which can be used in plug and play manner. Much similar to LEGO.

3. Modular vs Functional -> In functional, we have functions which are written in a single very big JS file. If we want to use the same function in a separate place. We can either script src that big file in the new place or copy that function.
With Modular programming -> We refer to these functions as modules (Like a component). Multiple components will make a big complex file and if we need to use it somewhere else. We just import it to that place.

4. Polyfill -> Since IE (old browsers) doesn't support new features. We as developers write compatibility code to support new features in old browsers. This code that we write is called as polyfill.

5. constructor -> Used to create the object from the class. (Instantiate). It's the first function of a class to get called when a new objec is created.

6. OOPS -> Object Oriented Programming.
It is a programming paradigm which revolves around the idea that everything is an object. Object can have properties or methods (functionality).

7. 4 Pillars of OOP
-> Encapsulation -> Everything is wrapped inside an object. (All the properties and the methods). Bundling of all the properties and methods.
-> Abstraction -> We hide (abstract) unnecesary data and methods from the user. And allow only selected methods/properties to be invoked/accessed.
Released in ES12. Jun/Jul 2021.

8. Private Class Features (Properties as well as Methods) -> ES12. (Just use #)


-> Inheritance
-> Polymorphism


2. OOPS in depth.
-> 4 Pillars of OOPs and see implementation of them.


Assignment 1:
- The library task which we have already done. Convert it into OOP based. Whatever UI is done, it's okay to keep as it is. IF not DONE. THEN DO SOME UI.(Approach 3)
