Difference Cookies vs Session

1. Cookie is persistent (permanent) upto the expiry / Session will be removed when the browser is closed.
2. Cookies are sent to the server with every network call / Session is browser only.
3. Cookies are small (4KB ✔) / Sessions are big (128MB ❓).
4. Cookies are String only / Session can store complicated objects also.
5. Cookie was before HTML5 also / Session was introduced in HTML5.

We will have a separate session on Cookies all together. Probably on the Weekday!
